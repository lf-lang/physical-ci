# Job image for the workflows in .github/workflows. It does not contain lfc: each workflow installs
# the lfc it tests into the job (lf-pr.yml downloads the one its build-lfc job built). The image only
# carries what that lfc and the program need: Java for lfc, a C toolchain with CMake and the Python
# headers for the Python target, and the program's Python packages.
